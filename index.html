    <p>Now time for the annual bday note of the year,</p>
    <p>Holy shit this bihhh 16. Aight so for the love of tung tung tung sahur, I might have lost this baddie to the brainrot gods. Jokes apart--I physically cant, all these years from 7th grade have been times to remember. From being NEAR to opps in 7th grade during the pin drop silence car rides to RSM, to the nonstop yapping otw back home from school, everything I cannot physically forget, not that i want to. I look up to the academic weapon that you are and aspire to be somewhere around there in the ball park lmao. i admire how anything may happen but it never compromise with how hard u work and how much you accomplish, i wish for so much more in the future. These days have been amazing, and i really mean it when I don't want this to end. This bihhhh better keep talkin to me after hs, as ur pretty locked in with me till graduation bc u still havent returned that pencil pouch. I'm not the best at communicating and you probably know that by now, but you are of SIGNIFICANT value to me. Thanks is not enough, not even this website to show that. you've been there for the best and the worst, which is a sign to me. live up the sweet 16th and i hope you have the best day ever, and i also hope that those blue cat eye'd nails do end up matching with your beautiful dress.</p>
    <p>I don't say it enough but I love u chat ðŸ’–</p>
